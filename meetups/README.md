# Meetup Grants and Guides

**_Funding for virtual meetups is available._**

**_Due to the COVID-19 pandemic we are temporarily suspending funding of physical meetups. Stay safe out there, wash your hands, minimize risk._**

Welcome to Do It Yourself Community Meetups, a place where you can find all the resources you need to host your very own meetup, virtual or physical.

## Project Snapshot

- Bring together your friends and local community
- Get funding in Dai
- Create learning opportunities around Decentralized Finance, MakerDAO, and Dai

## What are we trying to accomplish?

Maker is only as strong as its community. By hosting a meetup you can help build a local community that is passionate about DeFi, Dai, and the ecosystem that is being built around it. Through the meetups project, we seek to:

- Give passionate people the resources they need to organize successful meetups
- Fuel a grassroots and global movement that educates, inspires, and grows the DeFi ecosystem and community of people who understand and believe in what it stands for.
- Encourage collaboration on projects that build on top of the Maker Protocol, Dai, and the broader DeFi ecosystem.

## Project Description

This program is an important initiative of the Maker Foundation. We offer a [micro-granting program](./requesting-funds.md) to help fund local community meetups.

Additionally, we're working with the community to actively build a collection of guides to help anyone host their own meetup. Currently, these include a [Getting Started Guide](./getting-started-guide.md), [Budget Guide](./budget-guide.md), [Promotion Guide](./promotion-guide.md), an [Event Formats Guide](event-formats-guide.md), and [a collection of sample presentations.](./assets/slides)

## Is this for me?

### Hosting Meetups

Are you passionate about DeFi, MakerDAO, and Dai? Do you have friends who know nothing about this? Are you willing to organize and host an event, even a small one? If you answered yes, then this might be for you.

We're eager to support people who are passionate about sharing the vision of DeFi and teaching others how that vision is coming into being.

### Contribute to the Guides

Not in a position to host? No problem. We're constantly looking to improve the quality of our Guides. Here are some of the things we are looking for in contributors:

- Prior hosting experience
- Talent for writing or editing
- Willingness to give constructive feedback

We want to improve the depth and quality of the resources available to meetup organizers. If you feel like you can help make these resources more effective then this might be for you.

## How do I get involved?

## Important Disclaimer

These meetups are **not for speculating on the price of the token or general hype.** The main goal of hosting meetups is to bring people together and educate them about decentralized finance, Dai, and MakerDAO. When talking about the MKR token, the goal should be to educate the attendees about the purpose and utility of the token. Events should focus on the MakerDao ecosystem, how MakerDao and Dai interact with DeFi, decentralized governance, and other relevant topics.
