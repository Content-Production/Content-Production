_Hey everyone, thanks for checking out Maker Relay!_

Whether you hold Maker (MKR) or DAI, own a vault, or want to get more involved in MakerDAO governance, this is your one-stop-shop for updates on the MakerDAO ecosystem.

## Votes

### Executive Votes

There was a lot of executive activity last week to move the Dai peg back toward equilibrium.

Most recently, the [Base Rate was reduced and DyDx was whitelisted on the ETHUSD Oracle](https://vote.makerdao.com/executive-proposal/reduce-the-base-rate-whitelist-dydx-on-the-ethusd-oracle)

On Thursday, the Dai price was relieved when the [debt ceilings were adjusted](https://mkrgov.science/executive/0x4ff0258545528b01902d826368246f330eeabd2c):

- ETH-A increased from 260 to 340 million
- USDC-A increased from 80 to 140 million
- USDC-B increased from 10 to 30 million
- W-BTC increased from 20 to 40 million
- BAT-A increased from 3 to 5 million

On Tuesday, the Monthly Governance bundle was ratified which included an increase the ETH-A Debt Ceiling from 220 to 260 million and the following proposals:

## Current Events

### Debt Ceiling Raises

Last week saw two Governance and Risk meetings (7/29/2020 & 7/30/2020) focusing on raising the debt ceiling and risks to the system.

Demand for Dai from yield farming is putting pressure on the Dai peg, which went down to 1.01 but currently hovers around 1.03. The debt ceiling was recently raised and its capacity was utilized in ~48 hours.

These raises create a significant amount of tail risk for MakerDAO with so much ETH and USDC collateral in the system. ETH creates liquidation issues in a market crash and USDC has some centralization concern.

[@hexonaut](https://forum.makerdao.com/u/hexonaut) added a [thread to articulate base rates](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/we-should-be-lowering-the-base-rate/3439) and the [poll winner](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling-proposal/qmpvqs7gycpjdcpwbye4twvwxuhf4ax2tvt6i1pto5qd2p) was a move to -4% which [passed on Friday's executive vote](https://vote.makerdao.com/executive-proposal/reduce-the-base-rate-whitelist-dydx-on-the-ethusd-oracle).

### MIP17 - Debt Ceiling and Risk Premium Adjustments

[MIP17 Working Group Community Call Summary & Action Items](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/mip17-working-group-call-summary-next-steps/3464) from MIP Editor [@charlesstlouis](https://forum.makerdao.com/u/charlesstlouis):

> "MIP17 was initially rejected from July’s Governance Cycle due to both the solution’s timing and the lack of consensus towards it being the clear path forward for Debt Ceiling and Risk Premium Adjustments."

The current plan is try and re-architect for two different MIPs: altering MIP17 for simple Debt Ceiling Adjustments and a future MIP for Risk Premium Adjustments.

The team is hustling to get MIP17 revisions in before this week's Governance cycle begins. Respond to [the thread](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/mip17-working-group-call-summary-next-steps/3464) or message [@charlesstlouis](https://forum.makerdao.com/u/charlesstlouis) if you want to help.

## State of the Peg

_As of 08/03/2020_

![Peg](https://i.imgur.com/akK7bHo.png)

- DAI sitting closer to 1.015

![Dai Supply](https://i.imgur.com/CXXBwMQ.png)

- Over the past week Dai supply has gone up approximately 100 million.
- Total Dai supply sitting at 378,527,154.

![VWAP](https://i.imgur.com/iCz78xc.png)

- Volume at around \$148 million last week.
- Average VWAP price places Dai at \$1.021

![](https://i.imgur.com/7heN1KU.png)

- Past 24 hour volume at \$24 million
- 24 hour VWAP price at \$1.015

![](https://i.imgur.com/mAfSTjs.png)

- ETH vaults collateralization ratio is fanning out into stronger collateralization ratios.

![](https://i.imgur.com/HXC086S.png)

- The first significant liquidation wall is at \$267 ETH, at writing that would coincide with a a 33% drop from current price.

![](https://i.imgur.com/S20SAx0.png)

- Another large liquidation wall at \$239 ETH. A 40% drop would mean 106 million Dai being liquidated.

#### Peg Stability Mechanisms

[@Kurt_Barry](https://forum.makerdao.com/u/Kurt_Barry) summarized the Target Rate Feedback Mechanism (TRFM) in this [forum post:](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/the-target-rate-feedback-mechanism-an-introduction/2319)

> "The TRFM can be thought of (roughly) as an alternative to the DAI Savings Rate (DSR) that has more flexibility in terms of applying directional pressure to the DAI price.

> At a minimum, three new components would be required to fully implement an automated TRFM in the present DAI Credit System:

> - a DAIUSD price oracle
> - a target price calculator
> - a target rate controller

[MIP20](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/mip20-target-price-adjustment-module-vox/3196) describes a Target Price Adjustment Module called Vox. Vox is an implementation of a TRFM that adjusts the target price of DAI according to a governance defined rate, allowing the institution of negative effective interest rates.

[@equivrel](https://forum.makerdao.com/u/equivrel) notes that Kurt's introduction doesn't address the implication of changing the Target Price for monetary policy (from the current target of \$1.00).

> "Once we have credibly commited to pursuing the new Target Price as the monetary policy price target, only then will Target Rate Adjustment serve as an effective negative real interest rate.Once we have credibly commited to pursuing the new Target Price as the monetary policy price target, only then will Target Rate Adjustment serve as an effective negative real interest rate."

[@FourthStreet](https://forum.makerdao.com/u/FourthStreet) summarizes the state of discussions around the PSM in in [What?, So What?, Now What? PSM Solution:](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/what-so-what-now-what-psm-solution/3154)

> “How does MakerDAO scale while also defending the Peg and restoring confidence in the system in a manner that is sustainable and limits exposure to collateral risk (mainly USDC is the current focus)?”

FourthStreet goes on to describe four major cons with current plans for the PSM to open discussion on how the issues might be mitigated.
