### Vault Compensation

### Liquidations System 1.2 Upgrade

- [Liquidations System 1.2 Upgrade (Timeline)](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/liquidations-system-1-2-upgrade-timeline/3592/8)

The proposed change lets Maker Governance control to some extent the amount of simultaneous auctions that can occur at once.

[Mariano Conti clarifies,](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/liquidations-system-1-2-upgrade-timeline/3592/8?)

> [quote="Mariano_Conti, post:8, topic:3592"]
> "According to [http://makervaults.descipher.io/ ](http://makervaults.descipher.io/) the largest ETH-A vault has 37m Dai debt, second largest has 30m. If any of these 2 vaults were to be liquidated (they’re pretty safe right now) we’d see an immediate liquidity crunch, as keepers try to bid on an extremely large amount of auctions. I believe the risk to the system would be high, since in case of the first vault, 290,000 ETH would be auctioned, in up to 2900 different and simultaneous auctions."

### SourceCred Trial Update

- [Week 10 DAI Distributions, new instance system & payout mechanism - SourceCred trial](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/week-10-dai-distributions-new-instance-system-payout-mechanism-sourcecred-trial/3632)

This update marks Week 10 of the [trial of SourceCred trial](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/maker-sourcecred-trial/2551). 2500 Dai were distributed in the preceding week and July's payouts have been distributed.

SourceCred provides a system that allows users of the Forum to build credibility & create value through interactions.

That thread includes details about the algorithm being updated as well as the UI, actual numbers from the trial, and how to opt-in yourself!

### Should Voting Costs Be Reimbursed?

- [Should the Maker Community Reimburse MKR Voters for the ETH Transaction Fees Incurred when Polling and Executive voting?](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/should-the-maker-community-reimburse-mkr-voters-for-the-eth-transaction-fees-incurred-when-polling-and-executive-voting/3651?u=repotactics)

[@ElProgreso](https://forum.makerdao.com/u/ElProgreso) notes:

> [quote="ElProgreso, post:1, topic:3651"]
> This week it will cost anywhere from $20 to $50 to Poll on the current nine (9) open polls. And perhaps this is the reason why we have had such a low, low, turnout. More than likely—it is.

### Annualized Earnings Hit Zero

[@RyanWatkins\_](https://twitter.com/RyanWatkins_) published a tweet commenting on Maker's earnings, citing the following graphic from Messari:

> "While Dai's supply is going parabolic, Maker's annualized earnings effectively just hit zero.

> Interest rates can't get up and MKR holders aren't being compensated at all for their crucial role in managing and backstopping the MakerDAO system."

## State of the Peg 08-17-2020

![Peg](https://i.imgur.com/PupGSVK.png)

- DAI peg still above \$1 though it's come down since last week.

![Dai Supply](https://i.imgur.com/aNsiJas.png)

- ~427 million Dai, skewing even more towards ETH vaults.

![VWAP](https://i.imgur.com/J4N9xlb.png)

- Volume at around \$134 million this last week.
- Average VWAP(volume-weighted-average-price) places Dai at \$ 1.011

![](https://i.imgur.com/tLCOKBC.png)

- ETH vaults collateralization ratio spreading more evenly across the 200-350% CR buckets.

![](https://i.imgur.com/mdFKPAp.png)

- First big liquidation wall at \$319 ETH, a 27% drop would coincide with 38 million Dai getting liquidated.

![WBTC](https://i.imgur.com/FFhlyNj.png)

- For WBTC liquidating 38 million WBTC the price would have to drop 22% to \$9697.

![WBTC Vault](https://i.imgur.com/sjQhm9X.png)

- For reference, the largest WBTC vaults are closer to 200% collateralization (189%).
