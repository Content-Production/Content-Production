# Maker Relay 03

_Hey everyone, thanks for checking out Maker Relay!_

Whether you hold Maker (MKR) or DAI, own a vault, or want to get more involved in MakerDAO governance, this is your one-stop-shop for updates on the MakerDAO ecosystem.

## Governance

Governance and Risk had their 100th Episode Thursday!

This positive note was worth sharing:

"I thought I’d mention that this is such an amazing project, we’re at the 100th governance call, and we’re discussing a coveted good problem to have, which is that there’s a ton of demand for Dai. Not just from COMP, but from all over the market. And most startups, most companies, would die (Dai) to be in this position, no pun intended. Or maybe pun intended. I just wanted to call out and I know that we have hard decisions to make, and it’s going to be difficult to figure out how we scale, but this is the right set of circumstances that we want to grow this project. It’s exciting to be here. It’s exciting to be with you guys."
