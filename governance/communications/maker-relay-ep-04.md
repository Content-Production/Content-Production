_Hey everyone, thanks for checking out Maker Relay!_

Whether you hold Maker (MKR) or DAI, own a vault, or want to get more involved in MakerDAO governance, this is your one-stop-shop for updates on the MakerDAO ecosystem.

## Governance

[**Governance Polls Summary Thread**](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/weekly-polls-2020-07-20/3275)

[@MakerMan](https://forum.makerdao.com/u/makerman) pointed out the experience for voting could be aggregated and [@LongForWisdom](https://forum.makerdao.com/u/longforwisdom) delivered a more concise voting thread with Forum context and the voting portal unified.

[**Governance at a Glance**](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/governance-at-a-glance/84/76)

### MIPs Updates

The Maker Improvement Proposal (MIPs) Framework provides a clear process for Maker governance to change the Protocol as needed. Note that the MIPs editor keeps an [_excellent_ board of the MIPs process](https://github.com/makerdao/mips/projects/1) on github. Also note that @charlesstlouis began adding one liners for MIPs in the updates. ðŸ™Œ

- [Weekly MIPS Update #9 7/13 - 7/14](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/weekly-mips-update-9/3269)

[Signal Request: Should we raise the ETH debt ceiling?](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/signal-request-should-we-raise-the-eth-debt-ceiling/3228)

- 180 million was the winning poll option, was placed in Mondayâ€™s Executive Vote, and passed.

[Signal Request: Increases in the ETH and USDC-A debt ceilings](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/signal-request-increases-in-the-eth-and-usdc-a-debt-ceilings/3265)

- The farming trend is taking another turn towards YFI farming, the community signaled on what the new ETH and USDC-A debt ceiling should be.
  - 220 million for ETH with 68 total votes.
  - 80 million for USDC-A with 56 total votes.

## Working Groups

### Vault Compensation Analysis Team

[A recap from @adrianmcli](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/vault-compensation-plan-proposal/2900/21)

- The Initial Compensation Plan was voted against by MKR holders. It appears there is still interest in moving forward, so if you have feedback on the current plan please provide it in the threads.
- The team is wrangling feedback to understand how to proceed and may propose another vote.

## State of the Peg

![Peg](https://i.imgur.com/6Sk5cEv.png)

- DAI peg down very slightly from last week at 1.013.

![Dai Supply](https://i.imgur.com/Mehnj9N.png)

- 218 million total Dai.

![VWAP](https://i.imgur.com/q5aknYG.png)

- Volume at around \$33 million this last week.
- Average VWAP over seven days places Dai at \$ 1.015

![](https://i.imgur.com/SrU8TPA.png)

- ETH vaults collateralization ratio continues to grow in the 200-300 and 250-300 buckets. ~$67 million in the first bucket and $46 million in the second. Slightly more risk-on behavior as the ETH-A debt ceiling climbs.

![](https://i.imgur.com/Ei4IaS1.png)

- ETH at $150 nets out to ~34 million Dai liquidated but an even steeper curve at around $148 where \$75 million in Dai would be liquidated.

![](https://i.imgur.com/WX6d5Dg.png)

- WBTC Collateralization ratios even more bimodal, with 10 million at 200-250% and ~\$9 million at 150-200%

![](https://i.imgur.com/LkdNd51.png)

- First significant liquidation wall for WBTC at \$8226.

##### Governance and Risk Observation

[1:11:36](https://youtu.be/zyTd7pUX__M?t=4296)

- Vishesh: Considering the lifecycle of Dai is a little bit missing (in our calculus) but itâ€™s important to keep in mind that if the goal is bringing down peg you have to target use cases of Dai that will put more liquidity on the open market and help drive that price down.
