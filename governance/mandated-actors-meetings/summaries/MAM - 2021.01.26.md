# GemJoin Variant Coins

## Farm Tokens

Requires token wrapper.

Unified way of proceeding with these tokens.

Oracles need to be bespoke. So focus on the longer term tokens.

## Floating Value Tokens

Gems don't correspond 1:1 with the tokens coming out. For example, PAXG has fees.

- There's a ticket in the backlog for this type. The solution might not be easy.
- A wrapper might solve most issues.

# Priorities

### Working on MIP21 and MIP22

SC's working on the adaptor, trying to make a generic one.

First one will be the hardest.

March should be possible, as long as it doesn't collide with Liquidations 2.0

### The Keg

Some projects are dependant on it.

### Prioirity Sheet

Teams to review it and complete it.

### LP Tokens

Risk Assessment on track:

- [UNI-V2-ETH-USDT]
- [UNI-V2-DAI-USDC]

# DC Increase

1.5 B is the current limit with the IAM

Discussion around different vaults, risk, DCs.

- If we want the implementation of IAM this Friday it should be in the forum too.

# Careers Page

It would be good to have a technical PMO that could evolve into a role organizing Collateral Onboarding.

Discussion around:

- Implementation PMO.
- Collateral Onboarding Lead
- Technical versus BD

# G&R Meeting

- Nothing special
