# Collateral Onboarding + MIPs

## LP Tokens

Oracles will deploy later today.

Deploying on Kovan might delay the go-live.

Some keepers/integrators use Kovan to test different functionalities.

## Audit: LP Tokens (Oracles)

Conversations to audit the Oracles for LP Tokens.

The scope is quite restricted, so February 15th is the potential deadline.

They have provided the [tornado.cash](http://tornado.cash) audit they have performed.

## MIP21 + MIP22

6s tokens: Focus on Kovan next. Bandwidth is low, so might not be out this week.

MIP22 is next.

There's a lot of testing to be done (unit + integration) which is delaying deployment.

## In the pipeline

Stablecoins LPs could be attractive since they introduce low risk.

We need to check volumes as they might be too small.

ETH-pairs might be attractive.

Risk can be countered with fees.

### This Week

- [UNI-V2-ETH-USDC]
- [UNI-V2-ETH-WBTC]

### After That

- [UNI-V2-ETH-USDT]
- [UNI-V2-DAI-USDC]

# Liquidations 2.0

Next big topic. The developers need to start focusing more heavily on this.

# Onboarding more Developers

## Potential Teams: Developers needed

- L2 Research
- Security (Red Team)
- QA

## Developer Training Course

yearn has something similar. Maybe we should try to build one for Maker.
