# Liquidations

Discussion about current situation with liquidations after the drop.

"Kicking" the auctions manually could be a solution until Liquidations 2.0 are out.

### Liquidations 2.0

Mar 03 : Formal submission
Mar 10 : Final code
Mar 22 : Executive vote (this will be for the first upgrade in a series)

# Kurt is back!

He will be focusing more on the security side than the smart contracts.

# Collateral Onboarding

## This Week

- Dai-USDT

## Backlog

- ETH-C Vault
- YFI-ETH
- LRC-ETH

## MIP21 & MIP22

MIP21: Final Review + Kovan Spell being built.

MIP22: postponed until Liquidations 2.0's first deployment.

# Liquidations 2.0

A lot happening yesterday that shows the importance of this module.

Discussion about initial vault to test it.

ETH-C is a good candidate.

YFI and UNI would also make sense.

### Current Liquidations

Discussion about parameters and performance.

Potentially we could decrease `ttl` for `flips`.

# Vote Delegation

Discussion about potential solutions.
