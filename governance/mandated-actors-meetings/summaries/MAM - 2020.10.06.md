# Notes

## ETH-B - Onboarding Poll

If it passes the domain team will work on it to have it ready for the following week.

- [ ] LFW - Amend poll checklist to ensure that mandated actors are informed about onboarding polls.

## Technical Assessments

If there's no technical changes we don't need to redo a technical assessment for collateral types that are already onboarded?

For minor technical changes we could amend the original assessment and pass it to the risk team.
