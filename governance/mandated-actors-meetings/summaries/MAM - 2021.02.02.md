# Collateral Onboarding

### LP Tokens

Polls are up. To the executive on Friday.

Nik will post the oracles today.

### Assessments by Friday

- UNI-ETH
- LINK-ETH

Risk might not make it. Depends on bandwidth.

### Coming Next

- AAVE-ETH

### Sushi LP Tokens

They have upgradability in their rewards:

- Multisig
- Timelock delay

Can we get them to increase the delay?
Can we monitor + add a Governance Emergency Vote?

# Liquidations 2.0

We're still waiting for the audit, and then we need to do changes on that.

We probably won't make it for March.

# MIP22

The code is quite complex, possibly more than Liquidations 2.0.

Smart Contracts + Risk team to discuss different scenarios.

Discussion about risk and next steps.

# Core Units

Brief discussion about potential models moving forward.
