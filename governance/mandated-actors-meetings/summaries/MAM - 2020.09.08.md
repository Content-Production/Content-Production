# Notes

## MIPs

### Proposals

- COMP
- LINK

Once we have the Risk and Oracles assessment we're good to go to file the MIP12.

### MIP to Onboard Primoz as Risk Team

To be posted in the forums.

Charles will take care of the rest.

### Wil's MIP

UIs were displaying risk parameters wrong, but smart contract variables were correct. Some testing required.

### MIP10 Refactor

Might not be ready for tomorrow.

## Other Topics

### PSM

[A word on the PSM concept and next steps for the Foundation](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/a-word-on-the-psm-concept-and-next-steps-for-the-foundation/3293/18)

### Centrifuge

RWA: Contracts need to be analyzed, as they have new concepts. Bandwidth to be assessed.

Lots of complex elements interacting (2 blockchains, 1 bridge, oracles, legal, etc)

### Onboarding

We should communicate that prioritization is based on simplicity of onboarding, as it has a direct impact on the ecosystem. Let's be transparent about this.

### USDC-A Debt Ceiling

We might want to raise it in case of a black swam event.

Primoz will open a discussion to gauge sentiment.
