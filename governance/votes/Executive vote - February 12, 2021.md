### Debt Ceiling Instant Access Module Parameters for Multiple Vault Types

Given the successful outcome of the DC-IAM parameter polls for each of [UNI-A](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling/QmQtHoj6?network=mainnet#poll-detail), [AAVE-A](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling/QmU9zFqm?network=mainnet), [COMP-A](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling/QmaKzMQ6?network=mainnet), [LINK-A](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling/QmVgTLFE?network=mainnet), [WBTC-A](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling/QmSDQhiK?network=mainnet) and [YFI-A](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling/QmQQ3YS8?network=mainnet), these vault types will be enabled on the DC-IAM with the parameters listed in those polls if this executive proposal passes. The parameters for each vault type are listed in the summary section below.

This [Executive Vote](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/on-chain-gov) will continue until the number of votes in favor surpasses the votes in favor of the currently leading proposal. This is a [continuous approval](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/how-voting-works) vote. 

If this executive vote does not pass within 30 days then it will expire and have no effect on the Maker Protocol, even if it should later pass. 

Note that this proposal will include an office-hours modifier that means it can only be cast between 14:00 and 21:00 UTC, Monday - Friday. This is to ensure that at least some auction keepers are available to react to unforeseen issues with their bots in the event of early liquidations involving new collateral types.
