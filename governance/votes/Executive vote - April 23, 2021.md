# [Executive Proposal] System Surplus Buffer Increase and Burn, Parameter Changes, YFI-A Addition to Liquidations 2.0 - April 23, 2021

The Governance Facilitator(s) and the MakerDAO Smart Contracts Domain Team have placed an executive proposal into the voting system. MKR Holders should vote for this proposal if they support the following alterations to the Maker Protocol.

If you are new to voting in the Maker Protocol, please see the [voting guide](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/how-voting-works/) to learn how voting works, and this [wallet setup guide](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/voting-setup/) to set up your wallet to vote.

## Executive Summary

If this executive proposal passes, the following **changes** will occur within the Maker Protocol:
- The System Surplus Buffer will be increased from 30MM to 60MM over a period of 99 days, targeting 25% of incoming revenue used to burn MKR.
- Multiple changes to stability fees and debt ceilings will be made to various vault types as detailed below.

If this executive proposal passes, the following **additions** will be made to the Maker Protocol:
- YFI-A will be added to the Liquidations 2.0 framework.

**Voting for this executive proposal will place your MKR in support of the changes and additions outlined above.**

Unless otherwise noted, the changes and additions listed above are subject to the [GSM Pause Delay](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/param-gsm-pause-delay). This means that if this executive proposal passes, the changes and additions listed above will only become active in the Maker Protocol after the GSM Pause Delay has expired. The GSM Pause Delay is currently set to **48 hours**.

This executive proposal includes an office-hours modifier that means that it **can only be executed between 14:00 and 21:00 UTC, Monday - Friday**. This is to ensure that at least some auction keepers are available to react to unforeseen issues with their bots in the event of early liquidations on new collateral types.

The next executive proposal will be submitted on Monday, potentially resulting in this executive proposal being replaced if it has not passed by that time.

## Proposal Details

### Increase the System Surplus Buffer And Add Burn Percentage

Given the successful outcome of this [poll](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling/QmRmXKoJ?network=mainnet#poll-detail), the following changes to the System Surplus Buffer will be made if this executive proposal passes:

- The System Surplus Buffer will increase from 30 million to 60 million.
- Target 25% of the stability fee revenues to be used in Surplus Auctions to burn MKR. This will be achieved by increasing the System Surplus Buffer over 99 days starting on April 30th using a linear interpolation smart contract (`lerp`), instead of directly setting it to the target value of 60 million DAI. The 25% target assumes constant fees and no additional revenue over the time period. It should not be viewed as a guarantee of a specific percentage of revenue burn.

Further details and rationale can be found in the following [thread](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/signal-request-adjust-the-surplus-buffer-march-april-2021/6979).
