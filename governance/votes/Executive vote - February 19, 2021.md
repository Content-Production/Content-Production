### Revoke Stablecoin Permissions for Liquidations Circuit Breaker

As per this forum [post](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/limiting-governance-attack-surface-for-stablecoins/6057/7) from the MakerDAO Smart Contracts Domain Team, the Liquidations Circuit Breaker (`FlipperMom`) will no longer have permission to enable liquidations on PSM-USDC-A and UNIV2USDCDAI-A if this proposal passes. This will mean liquidations cannot be enabled for these vault-types without waiting for the [GSM Pause Delay](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/param-gsm-pause-delay). Please see the linked thread for further details on this proposed change.

## Summary

This [Executive Vote](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/on-chain-gov) will continue until the number of votes in favor surpasses the votes in favor of the currently leading proposal. This is a [continuous approval](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/how-voting-works) vote.

If this executive vote does not pass within 30 days then it will expire and have no effect on the Maker Protocol, even if it should later pass.

Note that this proposal will include an office-hours modifier that means it can only be cast between 14:00 and 21:00 UTC, Monday - Friday. This is to ensure that at least some auction keepers are available to react to unforeseen issues with their bots in the event of early liquidations.

## Review
