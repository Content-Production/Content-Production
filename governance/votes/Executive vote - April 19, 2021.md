# [Executive Proposal] Liquidations 2.0 Contracts, Increase Emergency Shutdown Threshold  - April 19, 2021
The Governance Facilitator(s) and the MakerDAO Smart Contracts Domain Team have placed an executive proposal into the voting system. MKR Holders should vote for this proposal if they support the following alterations to the Maker Protocol.

If you are new to voting in the Maker Protocol, please see the [voting guide](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/how-voting-works/) to learn how voting works, and this [wallet setup guide](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/voting-setup/) to set up your wallet to vote.

## Executive Summary

If this executive proposal passes, the following **additions** will be made to the Maker Protocol:
* The Liquidations 2.0 Contracts will be authorized.
* LINK-A will be moved to the Liquidations 2.0 Framework.


If this executive proposal passes, the following **changes** will occur within the Maker Protocol:
* The Emergency Shutdown Threshold will increase from 50,000 MKR to 75,000 MKR.

**Voting for this executive proposal will place your MKR in support of the changes and additions outlined above.**

Unless otherwise noted, the changes and additions listed above are subject to the [GSM Pause Delay](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/param-gsm-pause-delay). This means that if this executive proposal passes, the changes and additions listed above will only become active in the Maker Protocol after the GSM Pause Delay has expired. The GSM Pause Delay is currently set to **48 hours**.

This executive proposal includes an office-hours modifier that means that it **can only be executed between 14:00 and 21:00 UTC, Monday - Friday**. This is to ensure that at least some auction keepers are available to react to unforeseen issues with their bots in the event of early liquidations on new collateral types.

If this executive proposal does not pass within 30 days, then it will expire and can no longer have any effect on the Maker Protocol.

## Proposal Details

### Authorize Liquidations 2.0 Contracts

Given the passing of this [executive](https://vote.makerdao.com/executive/6058cea1efe023001bfeb313?network=mainnet#proposal-detail) the following contracts will be authorized to implement Liquidations 2.0 if this executive proposal passes:
* Add contract "MCD_DOG" - The liquidation module contract, a full upgrade to the previous `cat` contract for liquidations.
* Replace contract "MCD_END" - Contract for executing a shutdown of the protocol.
* Replace contract "MCD_ESM" - Emergency Shutdown Module contract that enables burning MKR to shut the protocol down.
* Replace contract "ILK_REGISTRY" - Contract defining the different vault types within the protocol.
* Add contract "CLIPPER_MOM" - Contract that enables a "circuit breaker" for Liquidations 2.0 if the price of a collateral drops too severely.
* Add contract "MCD_CLIP_LINK_A" - Contract containing the LINK-A auction module (with the parameters listed below).
* Add contract "MCD_CLIP_CALC_LINK_A" - Contract that contains the Auction Price Function for LINK-A. 
* Remove contract "MCD_FLIP_LINK_A" - The previous contract setting the LINK-A liquidation parameters.

**Global Parameters**  
* [Global Liquidation Limit (`Hole`)](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/param-global-liquidation-limit): 100 million DAI

### Increase Emergency Shutdown Threshold

Following this [Risk Evaluation](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/informal-poll-should-we-raise-the-minimum-mkr-needed-to-call-end-cage-for-emergency-shutdown/7277/16) and the subsequent [decision by the Governance Facilitator(s)](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/emergency-shutdown-module-threshold-change/7526), the following change will be made to the amount of MKR tokens needed to activate an Emergency Shutdown (call `end.cage`) if this executive proposal passes:
* Increase threshold from 50,0000 MKR to 75,000 MKR.
