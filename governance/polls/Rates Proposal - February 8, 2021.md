# Poll: Rates Proposal - February 8, 2021

The Governance Facilitators have placed a Governance Poll into the voting system on behalf of the Rates Working Group. This Governance [Poll](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/on-chain-gov) will be active for three days beginning on Monday, February 8 at 16:00 UTC.

**This is a binary vote. In a binary vote, you may vote for a single option. You should vote for the option which you prefer. Alternatively, if you would accept either of the two options and have no preference between them, you should vote 'Abstain'.**
