# Monthly MIPs Governance Poll - March 15, 2021

The Governance Facilitators have placed the MIP3: Monthly Governance Poll into the voting system. This Governance [Poll](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/on-chain-gov) will be active for three days beginning on Monday, March 15 at 16:00 UTC.

**This is a binary vote. In a binary vote, you may vote for a single option. You should vote for the option which you prefer. Alternatively, if you would accept either of the two options and have no preference between them, you should abstain.**
