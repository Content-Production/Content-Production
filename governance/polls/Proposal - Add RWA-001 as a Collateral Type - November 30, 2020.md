# Poll: Add RWA-001 (6s Capital) as a Collateral Type - November 30, 2020

The MakerDAO governance facilitator has placed a Governance Poll into the [voting system](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling) on behalf of the MakerDAO mandated actors. This poll allows the MakerDAO governance community to signal their support or opposition to adding RWA-001 (6s Capital) as a collateral type in the Maker Protocol.

This Governance [Poll](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/on-chain-gov) will be active for three days beginning on Monday, November 30 at 16:00 UTC.

**This is a binary vote. In a binary vote, you may vote for a single option. You should vote for the option which you prefer. Alternatively, if you would accept either of the two options and have no preference between them, you should abstain.**

## Review

The proposed initial system parameters for RWA-001 (6s Capital) are:

- Stability Fee: 3%
- Debt Ceiling: 15 Million DAI
- Liquidation: See [MIP21](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/mip21-real-world-assets-off-chain-asset-backed-lender/3917) for details.

Note that due to the nature of Real-World Assets, many of the usual system parameters do not apply to this vault-type and have been excluded from this list.

Please review the following forum threads containing information about RWA-001 (6s Capital) to inform your position before voting.

## Outcomes

**If the votes for the 'Yes' option exceed the votes for the 'No' option then the following actions will be taken:**

- RWA-001 (6s Capital) will be included in a future executive vote as the Smart Contracts domain team's schedule allows.
- It is expected that this executive vote will take place within 30 days of this poll passing, absent external factors.

**If the votes for the 'No' option equal or exceed the votes for the 'Yes' option then no further action will be taken at this time.**
