# Poll: Increase the ETH-A Debt Ceiling - January 18, 2021

The Governance Facilitators have placed a Governance Poll into the voting system on behalf of the Maker Governance Community. This Governance [Poll](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/on-chain-gov) will be active for three days beginning on Monday, January 18 at 16:00 UTC.

**This is a binary vote. In a binary vote, you may vote for a single option. You should vote for the option which you prefer. Alternatively, if you would accept either of the two options and have no preference between them, you should abstain.**

## Review 

MKR Token Holders may vote in this poll to express support or opposition to adjusting the ETH-A [Debt Ceiling](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/param-debt-ceiling):
* Increase from 740 million DAI to 1 billion DAI.

Please review the discussion [thread](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/signal-request-adjust-eth-a-debt-ceiling-2021-02/5993) to inform your position on this issue before voting.

## Outcomes

**If the votes for the 'Yes' option exceed the votes for the 'No' option then the following actions will be taken:**
* This parameter change will be included in the weekly Executive Vote on the Friday following the conclusion of this poll. 
* If the Friday executive passes, then this parameter change will become active in the Maker Protocol after the [GSM Pause Delay](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/param-gsm-pause-delay) has expired.

**If the votes for the 'No' option equal or exceed the votes for the 'Yes' option then no further action will be taken at this time.**
