# Poll: Adjust the ETH-B Debt Ceiling - December 7, 2020

The Governance Facilitators have placed a Governance Poll into the voting system on behalf on behalf of the Maker Governance community. The community can vote in this poll to express support or opposition to adjusting the ETH-B Debt Ceiling.

This Governance [Poll](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/on-chain-gov) will be active for three days beginning on Monday, December 7 at 16:00 UTC.

**This is a binary vote. In a binary vote, you may vote for a single option. You should vote for the option which you prefer. Alternatively, if you would accept either of the two options and have no preference between them, you should abstain.**

## Review 

The proposed adjustment to the ETH-B vault type is as follows:
* Increase the ETH-B Debt Ceiling from 10 million DAI to 20 million DAI.

Please review the discussion [thread](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/signal-request-adjust-eth-b-debt-ceiling/5282) to inform your position on this issue before voting.

## Outcomes

**If the votes for the 'Yes' option exceed the votes for the 'No' option then the following actions will be taken:**
* This parameter change will be included in the weekly Executive Vote on the Friday following the conclusion of this poll. 
* If the Friday executive passes, then this parameter change will become active in the Maker Protocol after the [Governance Security Module](https://forum.makerdao.com/tag/govsec-module) delay has expired.

**If the votes for the 'No' option equal or exceed the votes for the 'Yes' option then no further action will be taken at this time.**
