# Poll: Investigate implementation of an ETH-C vault-type with a higher LR - February 1, 2021

The Governance Facilitators have placed a Governance Poll into the voting system on behalf of the Maker Community. This Governance [Poll](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/on-chain-gov) will be active for three days beginning on Monday, February 1 at 16:00 UTC.

**This is a binary vote. In a binary vote, you may vote for a single option. You should vote for the option which you prefer. Alternatively, if you would accept either of the two options and have no preference between them, you should abstain.**

## Review

This poll asks whether an ETH-C vault type with a higher [Liquidation Ratio](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/param-liquidation-ratio) should be prioritized for inclusion in the Maker Protocol by the [domain teams](https://github.com/makerdao/mips/blob/Accepted/MIP7/mip7.md#mip7c2-the-current-domain-roles-list). 

Please review the discussion [thread](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/signal-request-new-vault-type-for-eth-with-a-higher-lr/6069) to help inform your position before voting.

## Outcomes

**Regardless of the winning option the following actions will be taken at the conclusion of this poll:**
* An ETH-C vault-type will be added to the [Collateral Prioritisation Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1IX9e2fyfz7djtDMKn5gMyGsyFxHoY75GncMbAjnSXrM/edit#gid=0) by the Governance Facilitator(s). 
* This vault-type will be added with a 'greenlight score' calculated using the outcome of this poll using the formula `Score = 'Yes' Votes - 'No' Votes`
* The Domain Teams will use the Collateral Prioritisation Sheet to direct their work on onboarding new vault-types.
