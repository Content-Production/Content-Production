# Poll: Community Greenlight Poll - WFIL (Wrapped Filecoin) - December 14, 2020

## Description

The Governance Facilitators have placed a governance poll into the [voting system](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling) as part of their responsibilities as defined in [MIP9: Community Greenlight](https://github.com/makerdao/mips/blob/Accepted/MIP9/mip9.md). This Governance [Poll](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/on-chain-gov) will be active for fourteen days beginning on Monday, December 14 at 16:00 UTC.

**This is a binary vote. In a binary vote, you may vote for a single option. You should vote for the option which you prefer. Alternatively, if you would accept either of the two options and have no preference between them, you should abstain.**

## Review

This poll asks whether the asset WFIL (Wrapped Filecoin) should be prioritized for inclusion in the Maker Protocol by the [domain teams](https://github.com/makerdao/mips/blob/Accepted/MIP7/mip7.md#mip7c2-the-current-domain-roles-list). 

Note that this poll refers to the WFIL token created and operated by [wrapped.com](https://www.wrapped.com/). Given the current confusion due to multiple projects competing for the WFIL token symbol, the name of this token may change in the future as the market for both tokens develops.

Please review the collateral onboarding application [thread](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/wfil-mip6-collateral-onboarding-application/5205) to inform your position before voting.

## Outcomes

**Regardless of the winning option the following actions will be taken at the conclusion of this poll:**
* The 'greenlight score' will be calculated for WFIL (Wrapped Filecoin) using the formula `Score = 'Yes' Votes - 'No' Votes`
* The 'greenlight score' for WFIL (Wrapped Filecoin) will be added to the [Collateral Prioritisation Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1IX9e2fyfz7djtDMKn5gMyGsyFxHoY75GncMbAjnSXrM/edit#gid=0) by the Governance Facilitator(s).
* The Domain Teams will use the Collateral Prioritisation Sheet to direct their work on onboarding new collateral types.
