# Monthly MIPs Governance Poll - $date_MONTH_DD,_YYYY

The Governance Facilitators have placed the monthly MIPs Governance Poll into the voting system as part of the responsibilities defined in [MIP3](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/60626de7e65b747f996b3d4e). This Governance [Poll](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/on-chain-gov) will be active for three days beginning on $date_DAY,_MONTH_DD at 16:00 UTC.

**This is a binary vote.**
- **You may vote for a single option.**
- **You should vote for the option which you prefer.**
- **If you would accept either option, you should vote 'Abstain'.**

## Review

This poll asks whether the bundled contents of this month's Governance Cycle should proceed to an Executive Vote to be held on $executive_date. The bundled contents of this poll consist of:

- [$proposal_name1]($proposal_link1)
   - ($sentence_description)
- [$proposal_name2]($proposal_link2)
   - ($sentence_description)
- [$proposal_name...]($proposal_link...)
   - ($sentence_description)

The proposals can be reviewed in this week's MIPs update [here]($discussion_link). It was also discussed on the latest [Governance and Risk call]($last_governance_call) on $last_governance_call_date_MONTH_DD,_YYYY.

## Outcomes

**If the votes for the 'Yes' option exceed the votes for the 'No' option, then the following actions will be taken:**
* This MIPs bundle will proceed to the final ratification vote (Executive Vote) in the last week of the monthly Governance Cycle provided the Governance Facilitators confirm a 'yes' outcome of the Monthly Governance Poll on the next Governance and Risk call on $next_governance_call_date_MONTH_DD,_YYYY.
* The Executive Vote will be submitted on $next_executive_date_MONTH_DD,_YYYY assuming a positive outcome is confirmed by the Governance Facilitators.

**If the votes for the 'No' option equal or exceed the votes for the 'Yes' option, then no further action will be taken at this time.**
* Proposals may be resubmitted to the governance cycle up to three times if they are voted down.
