# Rates Proposal - January 11, 2021

The Governance Facilitator(s) have placed a Governance Poll into the voting system on behalf of the Rates Working Group. This Governance [Poll](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/on-chain-gov) will be active for three days beginning on Monday, January 11 at 16:00 UTC.

**This is a binary vote. In a binary vote, you may vote for a single option. You should vote for the option which you prefer. Alternatively, if you would accept either of the two options and have no preference between them, you should vote 'Abstain'.**

## Review

MKR Token Holders may vote in this poll to express support or opposition to the following [Stability Fee](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/param-stability-fee) changes: 
* Increase the ETH-A Stability Fee from 2.5% to 3.5%.
* Increase the ETH-B Stability Fee from 5% to 6.5%.
* Decrease the WBTC-A Stability Fee from 4.5% to 4%.
* Decrease the YFI-A Stability Fee from 9% to 6%.
* Decrease the MANA-A Stability Fee from 10% to 5%.
* Decrease the AAVE-A Stability Fee from 6% to 4%.

Please review the proposal [thread](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/rates-changes-proposal-6-jan-2021/5948) to help inform your position before voting.

## Outcomes

**If the votes for the 'Yes' option exceed the votes for the 'No' option then the following actions will be taken:**
* These Stability Fee changes will be included in the weekly Executive Vote on the Friday following the conclusion of this poll.
* If the Friday executive passes, then these changes will become active in the Maker Protocol after the [GSM Pause Delay](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/param-gsm-pause-delay) has expired.

**If the votes for the 'No' option equal or exceed the votes for the 'Yes' option then no further action will be taken at this time.**
