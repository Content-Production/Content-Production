# Poll: Initial Flash Mint Module Fee - February 22, 2021

The Governance Facilitators have placed a Governance Poll into the voting system on behalf of the Maker Governance Community. This Governance [Poll](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/on-chain-gov) will be active for three days beginning on Monday, February 22 at 16:00 UTC.

**This is a binary vote. In a binary vote, you may vote for a single option. You should vote for the option which you prefer. Alternatively, if you would accept either of the two options and have no preference between them, you should vote 'Abstain'.**

## Review 

This vote is to determine the initial fee for [MIP25: Flash Mint Module](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/mip25-flash-mint-module/4400).

Please review the discussion [thread](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/signal-request-initial-flash-mint-module-fee/6485) to inform your position on this issue before voting.

## Outcomes

**At the conclusion of this poll the following actions will be taken:**
* The option with the most votes (excluding 'Abstain') will be used as the initial Flash Mint Module Fee when the Flash Mint Module is implemented.
* Implementation of the Flash Mint Module will be prioritized by the Smart Contracts Domain Team against other work.
