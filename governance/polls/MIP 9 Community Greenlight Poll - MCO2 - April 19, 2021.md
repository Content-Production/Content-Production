# Poll: Community Greenlight Poll - MCO2 (Moss Carbon Credit) - April 19, 2021

The Governance Facilitators have placed a governance poll into the [voting system](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling) as part of their responsibilities as defined in [MIP9: Community Greenlight](https://github.com/makerdao/mips/blob/master/MIP9/mip9.md). This Governance [Poll](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/on-chain-gov) will be active for fourteen days beginning on Monday, April 19 at 16:00 UTC.

**This is a binary vote.** 
- **You may vote for a single option.** 
- **You should vote for the option which you prefer.**
- **If you would accept either option, you should vote 'Abstain'.**
