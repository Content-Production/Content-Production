# Inclusion Poll for MIP9 Amendments (MIP4c2-SP8) - April 12, 2021

The Governance Facilitators have placed an inclusion poll into the [voting system](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling) as part of their responsibilities as defined in [MIP3](https://github.com/makerdao/mips/blob/master/MIP3/mip3.md). This Governance [Poll](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/on-chain-gov) will be active for three days beginning on Monday, April 12 at 16:00 UTC.

**This is a binary vote.** 
- **You may vote for a single option.** 
- **You should vote for the option which you prefer.**
- **If you would accept either option, you should vote 'Abstain'.**
