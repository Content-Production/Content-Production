# Create Multiple Oracles for dYdX on Starkware - February 1, 2021

The Governance Facilitators have placed a Governance Poll into the voting system on behalf of the Oracle Domain Team. This Governance [Poll](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/on-chain-gov) will be active for three days beginning on Monday, February 1 at 16:00 UTC.

Note: This subproposal has been submitted under the informal weekly cycle rather than the MIP3 Governance Cycle due to inconsistencies between MIP10 and MIP3 and to avoid delaying progress in the oracles domain until MIP10 can be amended.

**This is a binary vote. In a binary vote, you may vote for a single option. You should vote for the option which you prefer. Alternatively, if you would accept either of the two options and have no preference between them, you should abstain.**

## Review

The community can vote in this poll to express support or opposition to creating multiple oracles that will be used by dYdX on Starkware. Below is a list of each oracle, which can also be found in [MIP10c9-SP21](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/mip10c3-sp21-subproposal-to-create-oracles-for-dydx-on-starkware/6238):

- DOT/USD
- SNX/USD
- FIL/USD
- ZEC/USD
- CRV/USD
- WNXM/USD
- XRP/USD
- SOL/USD
- AVAX/USD
- XTZ/USD
- BTC/USD
- ETH/USD
- LINK/USD
- YFI/USD
- UNI/USD
- COMP/USD
- AAVE/USD

DYdX does not require an oracle on the Ethereum network, and as such no medianizer and OSM smart contracts will be deployed on Ethereum as part of this subproposal.

Please review the application [thread](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/mip10c2-sp-dydx-starkware-oracle-requests/5413) to inform your position on this issue before voting.

## Outcomes

**If the votes for the 'Yes' option exceed the votes for the 'No' option then the following actions will be taken:**

- These oracles will be setup and become operational within 30 days of this poll passing, absent external factors.
- No changes are required to be included in an executive vote as a result of this poll.

**If the votes for the 'No' option equal or exceed the votes for the 'Yes' option then no further action will be taken at this time.**
