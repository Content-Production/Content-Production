# Poll: Investigate implementation of a WBTC-B vault-type with a lower LR - January 11, 2021

The Governance Facilitators have placed a Governance Poll into the voting system on behalf of the Maker Community. This Governance [Poll](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/on-chain-gov) will be active for three days beginning on Monday, January 11 at 16:00 UTC.

**This is a binary vote. In a binary vote, you may vote for a single option. You should vote for the option which you prefer. Alternatively, if you would accept either of the two options and have no preference between them, you should vote 'Abstain'.**

## Review

This poll asks whether a WBTC-B vault with a lower [Liquidation Ratio](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/param-liquidation-ratio) (similar to ETH-B) should be prioritized for inclusion in the Maker Protocol by the [domain teams](https://github.com/makerdao/mips/blob/Accepted/MIP7/mip7.md#mip7c2-the-current-domain-roles-list).

Please review the discussion [thread](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/signal-request-new-iam-vault-type-for-wbtc-with-lower-lr/5736/) to help inform your position before voting.

## Outcomes

**Regardless of the winning option the following actions will be taken at the conclusion of this poll:**

- A WBTC-B vault-type will be added to the [Collateral Prioritisation Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1IX9e2fyfz7djtDMKn5gMyGsyFxHoY75GncMbAjnSXrM/edit#gid=0) by the Governance Facilitator(s).
- This vault-type will be added with a 'greenlight score' calculated using the outcome of this poll using the formula `Score = 'Yes' Votes - 'No' Votes`
- The Domain Teams will use the Collateral Prioritisation Sheet to direct their work on onboarding new vault-types.
