# Poll: Add ETH-C as a new Vault Type - March 1, 2021

The MakerDAO governance facilitator has placed a Governance Poll into the [voting system](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling) on behalf of the MakerDAO mandated actors. This Governance [Poll](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/on-chain-gov) will be active for three days beginning on Monday, March 1 at 16:00 UTC.

**This is a binary vote. In a binary vote, you may vote for a single option. You should vote for the option which you prefer. Alternatively, if you would accept either of the two options and have no preference between them, you should abstain.**

## Review

This poll allows the MakerDAO governance community to signal their support or opposition to adding ETH-C as a new vault type in the Maker Protocol with the parameters below:

* Underlying Collateral: Ether (ETH)
* [Stability Fee](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/param-stability-fee): 3.5%
* [Liquidation Ratio](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/param-liquidation-ratio): 175%
* [Maximum](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/module-dciam) [Debt Ceiling](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/param-debt-ceiling): 2 billion DAI
* [Target Available Debt](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/module-dciam): 100 million DAI
* [Ceiling Increase Cooldown](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/module-dciam): 12 hours
* Auction Lot Size: 50,000 DAI
* Minimum Bid Increment: 3%
* Bid Duration: 4 hours
* Max Auction Duration: 4 hours
* Liquidation Penalty: 13%
* [Debt Floor](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/param-debt-floor): 2,000 DAI

Please review the following forum threads containing information about ETH-C and the underlying collateral Ether (ETH) to inform your position before voting.
* [Proposal Thread](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/signal-request-new-vault-type-for-eth-with-a-higher-lr/6069)
* [Risk Evaluation](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/eth-c-risk-parameters/6684)

Note that there is no oracle or smart contract evaluation for this vault type due to the previous use of Ether (ETH) as collateral in the ETH-A and ETH-B vault types.

## Outcomes

**If the votes for the 'Yes' option exceed the votes for the 'No' option then the following actions will be taken:**
* ETH-C will be onboarded in a future executive vote as the Smart Contracts domain team's schedule allows. 
* It is expected that this executive vote will take place within 30 days of this poll passing, absent external factors.
* If the executive vote passes, then these changes will become active in the Maker Protocol after the [GSM Pause Delay](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/param-gsm-pause-delay) has expired.

**If the votes for the 'No' option equal or exceed the votes for the 'Yes' option then no further action will be taken at this time.**
