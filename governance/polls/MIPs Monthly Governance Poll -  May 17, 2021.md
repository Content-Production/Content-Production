# Monthly MIPs Governance Poll - May 17, 2021

The Governance Facilitators have placed the monthly MIPs Governance Poll into the voting system as part of the responsibilities defined in [MIP3](https://github.com/makerdao/mips/blob/master/MIP3/mip3.md). This Governance [Poll](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/on-chain-gov) will be active for three days beginning on Monday, May 17 at 16:00 UTC.

**This is a binary vote.** 
- **You may vote for a single option.** 
- **You should vote for the option which you prefer.**
- **If you would accept either option, you should vote 'Abstain'.**

## Outcomes

**If the votes for the 'Yes' option exceed the votes for the 'No' option, then the following actions will be taken:**
* This MIPs bundle will proceed to the final ratification vote (Executive Vote) in the last week of the monthly Governance Cycle provided the Governance Facilitators confirm a 'yes' outcome of the Monthly Governance Poll on the next Governance and Risk call on May 20, 2021.
* The Executive Vote will be submitted on May 24, 2021 assuming a positive outcome is confirmed by the Governance Facilitators.

**If the votes for the 'No' option equal or exceed the votes for the 'Yes' option, then no further action will be taken at this time.**
* Proposals may be resubmitted to the governance cycle up to three times if they are voted down.
