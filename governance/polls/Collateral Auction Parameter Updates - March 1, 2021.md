# Poll: Collateral Auction Parameter Updates - March 1, 2021

The Governance Facilitators have placed a Governance Poll into the voting system on behalf of the MakerDAO Risk Domain Team. This Governance [Poll](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/on-chain-gov) will be active for three days beginning on Monday, March 1 at 16:00 UTC.

**This is a binary vote. In a binary vote, you may vote for a single option. You should vote for the option which you prefer. Alternatively, if you would accept either of the two options and have no preference between them, you should vote 'Abstain'.**

## Review

- Decrease the Bid Duration (`ttl`) parameter from 6 hours to 4 hours for all vault types where liquidations are enabled.
- Decrease the Max Auction Duration (`tau`) parameter from 6 hours to 4 hours for all vault types where liquidations are enabled.
- Increase the `box` parameter from 15 million DAI to 20 million DAI.

## Outcomes

- If the Friday executive passes, then these changes will become active in the Maker Protocol after the [GSM Pause Delay](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/param-gsm-pause-delay) has expired.

**If the votes for the 'No' option equal or exceed the votes for the 'Yes' option then no further action will be taken at this time.**
