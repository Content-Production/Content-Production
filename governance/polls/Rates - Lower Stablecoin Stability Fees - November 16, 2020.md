# Poll: Lower Stablecoin Stability Fees - November 16, 2020

The MakerDAO Governance Facilitator has placed a governance poll into the [voting system](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling) on behalf of the Maker Governance community which gives Maker Governance the chance to signal their support for lowering the stablecoin stability fees.

This Governance [Poll](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/on-chain-gov) will be active for 3 days beginning on Monday, November 16 at 16:00 UTC.

## Review

Maker Governance is currently in the process of settling whether we proceed with Stablecoin Action Plan [Option 3](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling/QmY1vJPs?network=mainnet#vote-breakdown) or the new [PSM option](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/signal-request-accelerate-the-psm-launch/5094) that was suggested this week. 

The [DsChief 1.2](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/dschief-1-2-flash-loan-protection-for-maker-governance/5115) migration will likely mean that we cannot make non-emergency changes to the Maker Protocol on November 27th and December 4th. The November 20th executive will likely be the last chance to make non-emergency changes before December 11th.

Given this delay, it may be advantageous to lower the stablecoin vault fees until the path forward can be decided.

Please review the discussion [thread](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/signal-request-lower-the-stablecoin-vault-fees/5131) to further inform your position on this issue before voting.

## Next Steps

If a result gains a majority of votes, the Stability Fees for USDC-A, TUSD-A, PAXUSD-A, GUSD-A will be lowered in Friday's executive.

Governance votes will continue to be run over the next few weeks to determine the specifics of either the Stablecoin Action Plan Option 3 or the PSM.
