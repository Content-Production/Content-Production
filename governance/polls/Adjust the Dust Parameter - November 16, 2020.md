# Poll: Adjust the Dust Parameter - November 16, 2020

The Governance Facilitators have placed a Governance Poll into the voting system on behalf of the Maker Governance Community. The community can vote in this poll to express support or opposition to adjusting the Dust parameter for all vault types.

This Governance [Poll](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/on-chain-gov) will be active for three days beginning on Monday, November 16 at 16:00 UTC.

## Review

Please review the discussion [thread](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/signal-request-increasing-dust-value/5122) to help inform your position before voting.

## Next Steps

If this poll ends with a 'Yes' majority, any required change will be included in the weekly Executive Vote on the Friday following the conclusion of this poll. If the Friday executive passes, then the change will become active in the Maker Protocol after the [Governance Security Module](https://forum.makerdao.com/tag/govsec-module) delay has expired.

If this poll ends with a 'No' majority, then no further action will be taken.
