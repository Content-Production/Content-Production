# Inclusion Poll for Direct Deposit Module (MIP50) - May 10, 2021

The Governance Facilitators have placed an inclusion poll into the [voting system](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling) as part of the responsibilities defined in [MIP3](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP3). This Governance [Poll](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/on-chain-gov) will be active for three days beginning on Monday, May 10 at 16:00 UTC.

**This is a binary vote.** 
- **You may vote for a single option.** 
- **You should vote for the option which you prefer.**
- **If you would accept either option, you should vote 'Abstain'.**

## Review

The community can vote in this poll to express support or opposition to this proposal being included in this month's governance cycle.

A summary has been provided by the MIP author:

*The Direct Deposit Module interfaces with third party lending protocols to enforce a maximum variable borrow rate for selected assets. Maker Governance is able to pick a target variable borrow rate, and the module will automatically deposit/remove liquidity to ensure that target rate is hit.*

Please review the discussion [thread](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/mip50-direct-deposit-module/7356) to inform your position on this proposal before voting. It was also mentioned and possibly discussed on the [Governance and Risk call](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/agenda-discussion-scientific-governance-and-risk-140-thursday-may-6-17-00-utc/7792) on May 6, 2021.

## Outcomes

This poll implements an **Inclusion Threshold.** The Inclusion Threshold is currently set to **3,000 MKR**.

**If the votes for the 'Yes' option exceed the votes for the 'No' option by at least 3,000 MKR then the following actions will be taken:**
* The Governance Facilitators will confirm the inclusion of this proposal within the next Monthly Governance Poll on the Governance and Risk call on May 13, 2021. 
* The Monthly Governance Poll occurs in week 3 of the [Governance Cycle](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP3#week-by-week-breakdown-of-the-monthly-governance-cycle).

**If the votes for the Yes' option DO NOT exceed the votes for the 'No' option by at least 3,000 MKR then this proposal will not be included in this month's governance cycle.**
