# Monthly MIPs Governance Poll - April 19, 2021

The Governance Facilitators have placed the monthly MIPs Governance Poll into the voting system as part of the responsibilities defined in [MIP3](https://github.com/makerdao/mips/blob/master/MIP3/mip3.md). This Governance [Poll](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/on-chain-gov) will be active for three days beginning on Monday, April 19 at 16:00 UTC.

**This is a binary vote.**
- **You may vote for a single option.**
- **You should vote for the option which you prefer.**
- **If you would accept either option, you should vote 'Abstain'.**
