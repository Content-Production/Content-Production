# Poll: Increase Debt Ceiling and enable DC-IAM for UNIV2DAIUSDC-A - March 22, 2021

The Governance Facilitators have placed a Governance Poll into the voting system on behalf of the MakerDAO Mandated Actors. This Governance [Poll](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/on-chain-gov) will be active for three days beginning on Monday, March 22 at 16:00 UTC.

**This is a binary vote. In a binary vote, you may vote for a single option. You should vote for the option which you prefer. Alternatively, if you would accept either of the two options and have no preference between them, you should abstain.**

## Review

MKR Token Holders may vote in this poll to express support or opposition to the following changes:

- Increase Maximum Debt Ceiling for UNIV2DAIUSDC-A from 3 million DAI to 50 million DAI.
- Enable the Debt Ceiling Instant Access Module ([DC-IAM](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/module-dciam)) for UNIV2DAIUSDC-A with the following parameters:
  - Ceiling Increase Cooldown (`ttl`) = 12h
  - Target Available Debt (`gap`) = 10m

Please review the discussion [thread](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/signal-request-increase-uniswap-dai-eth-usdc-eth-dai-usdc-debt-ceilings-add-dc-iam/7063) to inform your position on this issue before voting.

## Outcomes

**If the votes for the 'Yes' option exceed the votes for the 'No' option then the following actions will be taken:**

- These parameter changes will be included in the weekly Executive Vote on the Friday following the conclusion of this poll.
- If the Friday executive passes, then these parameter changes will become active in the Maker Protocol after the [GSM Pause Delay](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/param-gsm-pause-delay) has expired.

**If the votes for the 'No' option equal or exceed the votes for the 'Yes' option then no further action will be taken at this time.**
