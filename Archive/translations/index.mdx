## What Are We Trying to Accomplish?

MakerDAO is an inherently global platform, which facilitates the creation of Dai. As MakerDAO and Dai spread across the world, our focus is on creating universally accessible resources.

With inclusivity as a foundational part of our culture, our goal is to translate our current resources into as many languages as possible. Through the Translations Initiative, we are working to grant wider audiences access to materials about MakerDAO in their native languages.

## Project Description

This is a community-led initiative that uses Dai bounties to incentivize users to translate MakerDAO resources into their native languages.
