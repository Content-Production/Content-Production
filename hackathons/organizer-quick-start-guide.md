# Organizer Quickstart Guide

Welcome to the MakerDAO Quick Start Guide for Hackathon Organizers. Below you will find all the information you need to know before reaching out to us.

**_Please Note: Community Development is not accepting new sponsorships as we work through a larger than normal backlog of proposals, in addition to precautions for COVID-19. Sponsorship applications will re-open on July 1, 2020._**

## Hackathon Funding Requirements

Please reach out to us **no later than 4 weeks before the event.**

**At the moment, priority will be given to hackathons with the following:**

1. Very conservative sponsorship requirements (under \$5,000)
2. Located or targeted at Asia-Pacific (APAC), Latin America (LATAM), Eastern Europe, Middle East, and Africa (SEEMEA)
3. Direct connection to talent and hackathon attendees (chat, forum, github, etc)
4. Themes focused on governance, risk management, stability and derivatives, privacy tooling. Current hackathon challenge themes can be found under the ["Hackathons" label in the Community-Development Github](https://github.com/makerdao/community/projects/2?card_filter_query=label%3Ahackathons).
