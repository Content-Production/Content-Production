## Roles

There are many roles involved in growing a community project from idea to reality.

- **Contributor (Proposal Owner):** Creator of the proposal and the driver of the project. Leads meetings and communication, sets contributor roles, goals, timelines, and expectations.
- **Contributing Team:** Contributes responsibilities or expertise to the owner, or lead.
- **Adviser:** Supportive role that can help scope, follow up, brainstorm, test, and keep Community Development abreast of communications and project updates.
- **Approving Group:** Evaluators reviewing and approving proposals. A mix of Maker Foundation employees and seasoned contributors of the community.

## Phases and Statuses

There are three phases to a CDIP and three statuses within each phase.

Let your Adviser know if you need more resources than anticipated! They'll coordinate a meeting, outline any required resources, and present them to the Approving Group. Based on those additional needs, the project may:

- Pivot (resources approved and work continues)
- Pause (contributor holds progress until ready)
- Archive (project stops).
