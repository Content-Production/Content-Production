## Propose Your Own Work

### Community Development Initiative Proposals (CDIPs)

Get access to up to 5000 Dai of funding by proposing your own idea. We use Community Development Initiative Proposals (CDIPs) to determine the financing of self-directed projects. A CDIP is the scoping and framing tool for anyone interested in receiving funds for proposing new MakerDAO community initiatives or resources.
