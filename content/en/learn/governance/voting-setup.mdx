# Voting Wallet Setup

## Learn how to set up your digital wallet or wallets to vote on MakerDAO governance

Maker (MKR) token holders may set up their Voting Contract with a single hot or cold wallet, or, as a linked wallet.

The linked wallet provides a more secure setup enabling users to vote with a hot wallet while their MKR remains stored on a cold wallet.

## Linked-Wallet Setup

The Linked Wallet Voting Contract can be set up using hardware wallets like Trezor or Ledger, paper wallets using SETH, or two MetaMask Accounts.

Setting up a Voting Contract is a one-time action as long as the same wallet or wallets are used in voting.

This guide uses Trezor as the cold wallet and MetaMask as the hot wallet. The process is similar for other cold wallets.

### Setup with Trezor + MetaMask

Please have the Trezor wallet ready and the MetaMask browser extension installed and running. Log in and make sure the appropriate MetaMask account is selected.

Navigate to the [Governance Portal](https://vote.makerdao.com/). Before setting up the contract, connect Trezor and MetaMask.

<Process>


<Box>


#### Connect MetaMask

Find the [“Accounts”](https://vote.makerdao.com/) drop-down menu on the right side of the top banner. If MetaMask is active, the current account will show as an available wallet. Make sure this is the correct account and select it to use as the hot wallet.

</Box>


<Box>


#### Connect Trezor

In the [“Accounts”](https://vote.makerdao.com/) drop-down menu, select “Connect to Trezor.” The Trezor wallet must be plugged in for it to show up. Follow the steps to enter the Trezor’s pin and passcode. When prompted, select an address with MKR to use as the cold wallet. Click “Unlock Wallet.”

### Managing the Linked-Wallet Voting Contract

#### Top-Up Voting Contract

For security reasons, locking additional MKR into the Voting Contract can only be done from the cold wallet, in this case, Trezor.

<Process>


<Box>


To top-up the Voting Contract, make sure the cold wallet is plugged in. In the [Governance Portal](https://vote.makerdao.com/), select “Connect to Trezor” from the “Accounts” drop-down menu.

![Connect to Trezor](/images/voter-26.png)

Follow the steps to enter the Trezor’s pin and passcode.

When prompted, select the address that is linked to the Voting Contract.

Click “Unlock Wallet.”

![Select Linked Cold Wallet Address](/images/voter-27.png)

Return to the [Governance Portal](https://vote.makerdao.com/) and click “Voting Contract” to bring up the secure voting menu. Select “Top-Up Voting Contract.”

![Manage Voting Contract](/images/voter-28.png)

Enter the MKR amount to add to the contract and click “Lock MKR.”

Approve the transaction on Trezor.

![Lock MKR](/images/voter-29.png)

</Box>


<Box>


#### Withdraw MKR from Voting Contract

Use either wallet to withdraw MKR from the Voting Contract and return the tokens to the cold wallet. For this example, the MetaMask hot wallet will withdraw the locked MKR. The process is similar when using a cold wallet.

Make sure MetaMask is running, and the account associated with the contract is selected. On the [Governance Portal](https://vote.makerdao.com/), click “Voting Contract” to bring up the secure voting menu. Select “Withdraw from Voting Contract.”

![Manage Voting Contract](/images/voter-31.png)

Enter the MKR amount to withdraw from the contract and click “Withdraw MKR.” Approve the transaction on MetaMask.

![Withdraw MKR](/images/voter-32.png)

Once the transaction is confirmed, unlocked MKR returns to the cold wallet, and the contract manager reappears. The MKR balance in the voting contract will update to reflect the changes.

![Updated Voting Contract](/images/voter-33.png)

</Box>


<Box>


#### Break Wallet Link

The wallet link can be broken from either the cold or the hot wallet, in turn, closing the contract. In case the hot wallet is compromised, the cold wallet can safely withdraw MKR from the contract before breaking the link.

_Note: All MKR must be withdrawn before the link can be broken. Follow the instructions above to withdraw all MKR from the contract._

For this example, the cold wallet will break the wallet link. On the [Governance Portal](https://vote.makerdao.com/), click “Connect to Trezor” from the “Accounts” drop-down menu and connect to the Voting Contract’s cold wallet address.

![Connect to Trezor](/images/voter-34.png)

Return to the Governance Portal and click “Voting Contract” to bring up the secure voting menu. Select “Break Wallet Link.”

![Manage Voting Contract](/images/voter-35.png)

If not done already, follow the prompt to withdraw any remaining locked MKR.

![Withdraw Remaining MKR](/images/voter-36.png)

Otherwise, click “Break Link” to close the contract. Confirm the transaction on the cold wallet.

![Break Wallet Link](/images/voter-37.png)

Once the transaction is confirmed, the link is broken, and the voting contract is closed. To vote again, return to the Governance Portal to set up a new voting contract.

![Grant Permissions for MKR Token Transfer](/images/voter-43.png)

![Grant Permissions for MKR Token Transfer](/images/voter-44.png)

#### Lock MKR in the voting system

Set how much MKR this contract will hold. A contract voting with more MKR has a more significant impact on the system.

Lock in more MKR to\ the Voting Contract or withdraw locked MKR at any time in a single transaction.

Click “Confirm” and check to make sure the information is correct. “Confirm” again and approve the transaction on MetaMask.
