# On-Chain Governance

## Governance Polls

Governance Polls occur on-chain and can be accessed through the Maker Foundation's [Voting Portal](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling).

Polls use [instant run-off](<https://ballotpedia.org/Ranked-choice_voting_(RCV)>), so you can select multiple options and ranked-choices will be prioritized.

<CTA>


Governance Polls measure the sentiment of MKR voters, and are used to:

- Determine governance and DAO processes outside the technical layer of the Maker Protocol.

- Form consensus on important community goals and targets.

- Measure sentiment on potential Executive Vote proposals.

- Ratify governance proposals originating from the MakerDAO forum signal threads.

- Determine which values certain system parameters should be set to before those values are then confirmed in an executive vote.

- Ratify risk parameters for new collateral types as presented by Risk Teams.

# Executive Votes

Executive Votes occur on-chain and can be accessed through the Maker Foundation's [Voting Portal](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling).

Executive Votes "execute" technical changes to the Maker Protocol. When active, each Executive Vote has a proposed set of changes being made on the Maker Protocol's smart-contracts.

Unlike the other types of votes, Executive Votes use a 'Continuous Approval Voting' model.

Executive Votes can be used to:

- Add or remove collateral types.

- Add or remove Vault types.

- Adjust global system parameters.

- Adjust Vault-specific parameters.

- Replace modular smart contracts.

</CTA>


Anyone can create an on-chain Executive Vote using the MakerDAO governance contracts, however, there is no non-technical UI available to do this.

Users can create proposals, also known as "[Slates](https://docs.makerdao.com/smart-contract-modules/governance-module/chief-detailed-documentation)," through this [experimental portal](https://chief.makerdao.com/), or by interacting directly with the smart contracts.
