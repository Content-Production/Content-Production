# Borrow Dai

DeFi lending skips the red tape and cuts out the middlemen. Borrowing Dai is easy, but borrow responsibly.

There are two ways to "borrow" Dai within DeFi. Generate Dai on Oasis or use a lending platform.

## Platform Risk

Be mindful of the risks associated with lending and borrowing on the blockchain. Consider a platform’s risk rating on <a href="https://defiscore.io/">DeFi Score</a> for help gauging a given platform's risk. Users are encouraged to do their own proper due diligence.
