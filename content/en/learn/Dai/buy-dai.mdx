## Buy with Cryptocurrency

There are more choices when trading from other crypto-assets. Acquire Dai on either centralized exchanges, decentralized exchanges, or peer-to-peer marketplaces.

### Centralized Exchanges

If managing an Ethereum wallet or keeping it secure is a hassle, consider trading on a centralized exchange. They also tend to be more liquid, and some keep detailed trade records to simplify accounting later on.

### Decentralized Exchanges &amp; DEX Aggregators

A great way to obtain Dai is with a Decentralized Exchange (DEX). By design, DEXs are non-custodial, not bound by geographic restrictions, and don't involve trusting third-parties. They can trade straight from their Web3 wallet (e.g., MetaMask) while retaining full control of their assets.

DEXs offer numerous benefits, but there are trade-offs.

**Trade-Offs:**

- Privacy: Trades happen on-chain and, therefore, are pseudo-public. In some regards, a public link between transactions and addresses reduces privacy. However, it may help third-party software keep track of trades for tax and documentation purposes.

- Slippage: For large orders there is a risk of receiving a different trade execution price than expected, this is called slippage. To reduce this risk, a DEX Aggregator can be used to split up a large order across multiple DEXs.

### Peer-to-Peer Marketplaces

Peer-to-peer markets fill the gaps in regions that lack access to suitable exchanges or have restrictions on cryptocurrency trading. These marketplaces act as fiat on-and-off-ramps, enabling users to later trade on DEXs that offer more liquidity and fairer pricing.
