# Risk Teams

## Analysts contribute to risk assessment for the Dai Credit System

Not all risk teams will undertake the same duties and job functions.

Different analysts will have distinct specialties and skills, making it helpful to categorize them accordingly.

We aim to develop rich ecosystem of specialized risk teams responsible for various functions as needed.

For now, we define the broadest types of risk teams that will work for the DAO but as the needs for risk assessment become more specialized, we can expect to see additional roles.

### Responsibility

Risk teams are responsible for examining the risks associated with including a collateral asset in the portfolio.

Their most basic responsibility is to evaluate specific assets or sectors. For example, experts in the cryptocurrency space will examine coins such as bitcoin or ether, whereas traditional risk analysts might find the Security Tokens space more suitable.

A sub-class of risk teams might include generalists in charge of tying together the various collateral types in a cohesive portfolio. One of the primary responsibilities is to factor in proper correlation coefficients, a task they will likely collaborate on with the other teams.

A second critical role is to set the appropriate monetary policy. Risk teams will be in charge of suggesting appropriate DSR values as well as any collateral-specific adjustments that might be required.

After construction of the collateral portfolio with the appropriate monetary policy parameters, they can then submit the final package to the governance cycle.

Several operational details that need to be addressed:

What are the types of risk that need to be managed?

Are there different types of risk teams?

How does one ‘become’ a risk team?

How do they create and submit risk models?

How are they compensated?

### Oracle Teams

Oracle Teams are in charge of developing and distributing oracle backend software, as well as emergency oracle programs. For example, when new collateral assets are added, they must be accompanied with a corresponding price oracle.

An Oracle Team is in charge of facilitating the inclusion of that oracle. Lastly, an Oracle Team may oversee the productization of any oracle services.

### Smart Contract Teams

Smart Contract Teams are in charge of auditing tokens and building the corresponding adapters.
