MakerDAO is an Ethereum-based DAO that operates the Dai Credit System, a permissionless loan facility.

The Dai Credit System issues the cryptocurrency Dai, a [stablecoin](/resources/archive/stablecoins) designed to track \$1 USD with low volatility. Dai's stability dependends on a system of carefully crafted incentives.

Collateral can be retrieved upon repayment of the outstanding Dai amount plus an associated Stability Fee.

This architecture poses two pressing concerns:

**1. Where does Dai source its value?**

**2. What compels it to remain pegged to USD?**

The answers to these two questions are the focal points of most risk analysis surrounding Dai.
