## Setting Up An Event Page

To promote an event, you will need to create an event page. An event page should contain:

<List>


- **Name**

  - A good name describes the theme, main topic, or general ethos of the talk.

- **Time and Location**

  - A time and date that will be ideal for your target audience.

- **Description**

  - Describe the purpose for your event, the agenda, who is speaking, who is a sponsor, etc.

- **Details ("How to find us", etc.)**

  - Add any additional information unique to your event that a potential attendee would find helpful. This will vary depending on the event.

- **A Banner**
  - Flex your creativity and use the [**Design Files and Assets**](https://www.notion.so/makerdao/Maker-Brand-ac517c82ff9a43089d0db5bb2ee045a4) to create an attractive banner.

</List>


## Some Pointers

<List>


- Always update the events page with any changes that might occur.

- We recommend reaching out to attendees with reminders, updates, or teasers.

- In addition to the main event page, we recommend broadcasting your
  promotions on social media. See the MakerDAO socials above and don't forget to link to URL of the main event page.

- Incentivize attendees to bring their friends along. Give prizes and create competitions for attendees to share on Facebook, Tweet, etc.

- Collaborate with other Meetup organizers and run events together. Groups must be complementary.

- Collect pictures and media from your event. These can be used in promotions and provide a helpful reference for other organizers and when planning events in the future.
