# Event Formats

## Planning your next meetup

Defining the audience and purpose of the event makes it easier to decide how to structure the event.

### Audience

When planning an event, it's important to consider who it's for and what purpose it will serve.

Is the event for students who've never heard of crypto? Is it for developers looking to gain new skills? Maybe the goal is to help promote local businesses developing decentralized technologies.

## Formats

This section provides ideas for the different types of events organizers can host.

All events may be hosted virtually or IRL (in real life).

Here are some suggestions for different formats community members can utilize for both virtual and in-person events.

### Presentations

Good for introductions to various topics and ideas or deep dives focusing on usiness applications, integrations, and business strategy.

E.g. How did we solve our dapp's issues with Dai? How can Ethereum affect commerce and the future of currency?

### Debates, Panels, AMA Sessions, and Fireside Chats

Introduce audiences to new technologies or explore problems facing the industry.

### Workshops and Demos

Increasing engagement with attendees can add substance to very presentations or simply make the event more enjoyable.

Demonstrating how something works is a wonderful way to provide value for attendees

### Social Events

Who said meetups can't be fun?

Enabling attendees to purchase food and/or beverages with cryptocurrency can be a fun addition to an event. We don't fund bar tabs but here are some ideas for more casual events:

- Dai Dappy Hour

- Casual Maker and DeFi Fan meetups

- Games

- Raffles

- Dai Auctions

- Donation Matching Initiatives
