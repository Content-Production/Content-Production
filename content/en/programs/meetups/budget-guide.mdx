# Budget Guide

This guide explains how to manage the financial side of hosting a meetup.

Please submit a [Community Meetup Form](https://airtable.com/shr4HOtcZ8o3VZmek) to be considered for an honorarium to cover expenses for this event. We do not cover funding for banners and printed materials and encourage community members to be fiscally conservative when planning their events.

Here are some things to consider when budgeting for an event:

## The Space

What does the event space need to offer?

The requirements of an event space depend on the type of event being hosted.

If possible, always try to use a free space or one that might be offered as part of a secondary sponsorship. Local universities, libraries and crypto-friendly businesses are great places to start.

If the type of event requires equipment or access to a specific location, it may be worthwhile to pay a rental fee.

## Equipment

What type of equipment might be needed for the event?

Many meetups involve presentations; if this is the case, find out if the space has the equipment needed to facilitate this. I.e., a computer, projector, and screen. If the event is large enough, some form of voice amplification might be a good idea.

Ideally, the location should include everything needed to host an event. Before purchasing any equipment yourself, consider posting on the event page and reaching out for help from attendees.

## Food and Beverages

Will people want food or drinks?

Snacks and beverages can be a nice addition to a meetup but be sure to see if the venue allows food and drinks before making any arrangements.
