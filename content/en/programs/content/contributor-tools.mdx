# Contributor Tools

## This Guide introduces the tools used by the MakerDAO Community Development team and contributors.

The Community Development (Comm-Dev) team works with tools geared towards promoting open-source feedback, communication, transparency, and clarity. While there is no sophisticated software stack, contributors should be comfortable with the more heavily used tools and how they serve Comm-Dev.

Before starting work on a Community Development project, contributors are encouraged to study MakerDAO’s [contributor resources](/contribute/content/).

## Writing Platforms

<!-- This does not need to be here, we go on to cover these exact topics below?
1. **[Google Docs](#google-docs):** Start new projects in Google Docs and when seeking robust feedback.
1. **[HackMD](#hackmd):** Convert documents to Markdown and make final edits on HackMD.
1. **[GitHub](#github):** Use GitHub [Pull Requests](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests) to submit final versions. -->

### Google Docs

[Google Docs](#google-docs) is a collaborative writing platform, with features like suggestion editing and version naming. Docs simplify feedback and review and are easy to share between team members and contributors.

- Start new projects and create first drafts in Google Docs.
- Use "Suggesting Mode" and leave "Notes" when reviewing a document.
  - Suggestions draw attention to proposed changes.
  - Notes leave room for side discussions.
- Avoid including direct links in a Google Doc.
  - Use the Markdown format to simplify conversion later on.
    - **Incorrect:** <https://bad.link.com>
    - **Correct:** `[link](https://link.com)`
- Versions can be named, renamed, downloaded, or revisited at any time.
  - Versions help other contributors quickly find and see any changes.
    - **Example:** [Naming a Version](https://i.imgur.com/3geLDAJ.gif)
- Make sure to name versions before passing projects off for review.
  - Use descriptive names for versions.
    - Names should contain information specific to the contents of the file or version.
  - Include a version number in the name, along with any other relevant details.
    - Numbers after the decimal define draft iterations.
    - **Example:** V0.1, V0.2, V1.2, etc.

### HackMD

MakerDAO prepares its long-form documentation in [HackMD](https://hackmd.io/), a collaborative Markdown editor. HackMD also tracks versions, enables commenting, and allows multiple users to work on a document simultaneously.

**Note:** Run all drafts through [Grammarly](https://app.grammarly.com/) regularly, and before final submissions.

- Grammarly will catch most spelling and grammatical errors.
  - Review the suggestions to make sure they make sense.
  - **Do not blindly accept Grammarly edits.**
- HackMD does not identify spelling and grammatical errors.
  - Copy text from the rendered preview into Grammarly and address any errors it flags.
  - Grammarly will miss errors if it’s given raw Markdown text.

Pro Tip:

Install the HackMD Google Chrome [extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/hackmd-it/cnephjboabhkldgfpdokefccdofncdjh?hl=en) to make searching easier.

### Markdown

MakerDAO documents hosted on GitHub are written in Markdown, a plaintext formatting syntax. Markdown allows for easy conversion to HTML and various other outputs, making documents easy to read on the web.

- Learn the basics of Markdown:
  - [Daring Fireball](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)
  - [Markdown Syntax Guide](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)
  - [Practice Communicating Using Markdown](https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/communicating-using-markdown)

### Writing Specific

---

#### Best Practices

- Include line breaks above and below headings.
- Use top-level headers `#` only once per document.
  - Do not make multiple top-level headings.
- Avoid repeat headings.
  - They will break auto-generated navigation.
- Avoid trailing spaces.
- Do not use:
  - Em or en [dashes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Hyphens_and_dashes): `—`.
  - Ampersands `&` in titles and headers.
  - Pipes `|` in titles and headers.
  - Curly quotes. Use the plaintext version.
    - **Correct:** `"`
    - **Incorrect:** `“`
  - Escaping parentheses. Use normal parentheses.
    - **Correct:** `(SOMETHING)`
    - **Incorrect:** `\(SOMETHING\)`
- Add tasks using check-boxes as projects grow.
  - A dash and brackets (`- []`) on a new line show up as a check-box in GitHub's UI.
  - **Example:**
    - [ ]
- Ensure there is a single hard return at the end of a .md file.
- Use in-text comments for extra visibility when collaborating with other contributors on HackMD documents.
  - Click on the comment icon in the toolbar and choose an appropriate style.
  - Consider including a timestamp or username:
    - **Markdown:** `> Look Here! [name=John Doe]`
    - **Rendered:**
      > Look Here! [name=John Doe]
  - Make sure to delete comments before submitting Pull Requests.
- Use an emoji to call attention to an important point, when necessary.
  - Practice discretion and use them sparingly.
    - Do not load documents with emojis.
  - This [cheat sheet](https://gist.github.com/rxaviers/7360908) lists emojis and their Markdown shortcuts.

#### Naming Files and Versions

- Markdown file names should be lowercase.
- Use dashes `-`, not spaces, to separate words within Markdown file names.
  - **Correct:** `meeting-transcript-ep-01.md`
  - **Incorrect:** `Meeting Transcript Episode 01.md`
- Use descriptive names for Markdown files and versions.
  - Filenames should contain information specific to the contents of the file.
    - Context is provided from the directory or through the presentation layer (e.g., GitBooks).
  - **Correct:** `meeting-summary-ep-01.md`
  - **Incorrect:** `scientific-governance-and-risk-meeting-summary-ep-01.md`

Pro Tip:

For a document's final draft, name it "Final draft, moving to GitHub." Post a link to the HackMD file or a relevant page on GitHub.

#### VSCode

- Consider using Visual Studio Code and install the extensions below:
  - `Markdown Preview Enhanced`
  - `Markdown Linter`
  - `Code Spell Checker`
  - `GitLens`
  - `Prettier`
    - Prettier will auto-correct most Markdown mistakes.
  - The [vscode-markdownlint](https://github.com/DavidAnson/vscode-markdownlint#configure) GitHub repo describes how to edit the error settings JSON file.
    - Use it to address any Markdown errors that follow the Writing Style Guide (e.g., headers in G&R summaries).
