# User Testing

To verify a revamped portal experience we wanted to make sure that users are getting the most out of site. We began our journey with a content audit, a couple of figma prototypes, and some user tests to verify that a new architecture/visual design to the site would be a better experience. This page list out the methodology and has links to the anonymized user testing.

The interviews centered around four actions:

- Submitting a new idea for a community project
- Educating yourself on a Maker topic
- Apply for a development grant
- Editing content or finding out the process for edits

From content designer Ryan Cordell, the first five interviews can be found [here](https://www.notion.so/Usability-research-summary-8f64ef784fea46a3b68305bf3940cb72e)

Right before launch we held some more sessions with the same questions:

- [Interview 2](https://hackmd.io/JUT5f96fSNS0uBiScHnE8A)
- [Interview 3](https://hackmd.io/TWFiPWvCTpiNh8Pu3MpFsg)
- [Interview 4](https://hackmd.io/PLnjtDFjSDKgxTyakqahFA)
- [Interview 5](https://hackmd.io/kA8Dtf_tTKKlNKB_Mp_S_w")

Post launch in October, there was one opportunity to refresh the site actions using the new portal with a newer community participant. The revised questions included:

- Submitting a new idea for a community project
- Educating yourself on a Maker topic (voting)
- Apply for a development grant
- Editing content or finding out the process for edits
- Finding community members
- Finding community accomplishments
- Community Development mission/purpose

You can find the most recent [interview notes here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oQ_bJLw5HIejKl_hNxi-IbBPAirrwA2q3nVhJqElfp0)

Hopefully these notes give a glimpse into the user-centered approach for developing the community-development portal.
