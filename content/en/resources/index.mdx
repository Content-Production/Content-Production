## Welcome to the conversation about how to create cohesive community

This website is built so that anyone can **learn** from it, **use** it, **contribute content** to it, and **extend** it easily.
We want the people who write captivating ideas, and the people who code awesome tools, and the people who design our community brand
to be in a constant dialogue where ideas circulate smoothly and we all benefit from each other's unique skills.

This section has two parts to it:

1. dialogic guides to contributing the best content possible, leveraging the unique features of `mdx`  
   and the bouquet of powerful React components we have built for you. We'll take you from tentative comments in Google Docs to
   coding your own React components in a few short weeks...
2. an engineering log - or [colophon](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colophon_(publishing)>) - explaining how we built the site so that you can understand its inner workings, help us
   extend it and make it even more awesome, or use it as a boilerplate for your own project.
