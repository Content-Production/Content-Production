# Development Grants

The MakerDAO Community grants program funds projects that increase Dai adoption, support emerging economies, open new markets, provide novel uses for the stablecoin, or other further the MakerDAO Foundation's principles.

We allocate grants ranging from 5K - 50K Dai. We distribute blocks of funds as teams reach their predetermined milestones.
