# Development Grants

## The MakerDAO Core Community Development Initiative

We provide funding for all kinds of teams that create infrastructure and applications for the Maker ecosystem.

So far, since February 2018, we've awarded over 683,887 DAI.

## Requirements

The model we use to incubate our grants requires regular check-ins, operational transparency, high developer velocity, active repositories, and frequent communications with MakerDAO and other members of the cohort.

How well teams meet these requirements will determine whether they reach their milestones and whether additional funds will be released.

This grant is for any teams building on Maker or Dai.

<Checklist>


Self-direct your work

Actively commit to regular check-ins

Work fast and openly

Share code repository activity

Communicate with other members of the cohort often

Split your work into milestones, we distribute blocks of funds as teams reach predetermined milestones.

</Checklist>


Our [Grantee Playbook](/funding/development-grants/grantee-playbook/) will provide an idea of what's expected.

## Application

Due to the high volume of worthy requests we receive, and the limited resources available, we prioritize applications with conservative budgets.
