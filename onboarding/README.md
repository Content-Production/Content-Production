# User Onboarding Guides

Welcome to the community-built User Onboarding Guides: a place that teaches new users how to interact with MakerDAO and Dai. Whether you're a potential MKR voter, a Vault owner, or Dai user this section should have something for you. If it doesn't, reach out to us in our [chat](https://chat.makerdao.com/channel/community-development) or [forums](https://forum.makerdao.com/).

## Available Guides

- Learn to use Dai (_coming soon™️_).
- [Learn to use a Vault.](vault-onboarding.md)
- [Learn to vote and participate in Maker Governance.](voter-onboarding.md)

## What are we trying to accomplish?

Our goal is to create a single place where a set of reliable and up-to-date user onboarding guides can live. These guides cover Dai users, CDP users, MKR token holders who want to participate in Governance, and more.

## Project Description

These guides are created by members of the MakerDAO community and can be updated by anyone.

## How do I get involved?
