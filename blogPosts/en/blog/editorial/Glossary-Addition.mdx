Having trouble figuring out what everyone in the Maker community is talking about? Maybe you're writing about MakerDAO and need a quick reference to help readers understand your terms.

Either way, the community's got you covered with our handy new [Glossary](/learn/Glossary).

## Learn Terms Like...

#### Dai Savings Rate (DSR)

- A variable return earned by holding Dai in the DSR smart-contract.

#### Flap Auction

- A process in which the Maker Protocol sells a fixed amount Dai in the system for MKR that is then burned to reduce its total supply. Also known as a "Surplus Auction."
  - [Documentation](https://auctions.makerdao.com/flap)

#### Oracle Security Module

- A security mechanism that delays and publishes the reference price produced by the Oracle System. A delayed price feed helps vault owners avoid potential liquidations caused by short-term volatility of Collateral assets and allows time to add Collateral in the case of large changes in the value of Collateral assets.

#### Vault

- A core component of the Maker Protocol that facilitates the creation of Dai against locked up Collateral and allows for the destruction of Dai when repaying generated Dai balances.
