Stablecoins have become one of the foundational legos of DeFi. The concept is simple: offer a digital asset that provides stability in the face of the wild volatility of the cryptocurrency markets.

How stablecoins go about creating that stability is where the story gets interesting. 

Some maintain a peg with familiar currencies like US Dollars or Euros, some rely on collateral, and others use advanced algorithms. The reality is, there are just about as many tactics for maintaining a peg as there are stablecoins!

This article introduces the benefits of stablecoins, explains how different stablecoins can be classified, and provides an overview of the different stablecoins currently available.

## Why Use Stablecoins?

Stablecoins offer a number of benefits to users, the most notable being their ability to function as digital dollars in cryptocurrency.

Whether you’re trading, investing, or looking to purchase something, trying to calculate your costs when the spot price of popular cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ether fluctuate by as much as 20% to 30% a day can become a confusing mess for the average Joe. 

Most stablecoins are pegged to familiar currencies like the U.S. Dollar, which makes them easy to understand and use.

With DAI, specifically, we often hear the question: “why would I lock up my Ether (ETH) if I can only borrow less than its full value?” The simple answer is leverage and flexibility. Someone who mints DAI against any asset used as collateral can use their DAI to purchase more assets or make other transactions. Borrowing Dai means getting access to liquid capital without having to sell the underlying collateral.

## Types of Stablecoins

Stablecoins may be categorized according to whether or not they can be minted without permission and the method used to maintain stability.

For example, DAI is pegged to the US dollar, can be minted with permission, and uses crypto as collateral, while USDC is pegged to the dollar, can’t be minted without permission, and uses fiat as collateral.

The most popular stablecoins aim to maintain a peg with familiar currencies like the U.S. Dollar or Euros. 

### Collateral-Backed

**Collateral-backed** stablecoins use other cryptocurrencies or baskets of cryptocurrencies as collateral to maintain a peg with a familiar currency like the US dollar.

Collateral-backed stablecoins may be centralized or decentralized. **Decentralized** stablecoins can be minted and used by anyone by interacting with the code in a smart contract hosted on a blockchain. 

Unlike decentralized stablecoins, **centralized** stablecoins work more like “IoUs” (I owe you). These stablecoins are minted when someone purchases them from an organization that exchanges fiat currency for their stablecoin. Some don’t consider centralized stablecoins to be stablecoins. However, their popularity among investors can’t be denied.

Different stablecoins take different approaches in building their collateral portfolio. Some protocols that create stablecoins allow a variety of collateral types to be used; others only allow a single type. Types of collateral that may be accepted include:

- Fiat Currency
- Cryptocurrency
- Stablecoins
- Real-World Assets (coming soon)

MakerDAO originally launched with single-collateral Dai (SAI), which only accepted Ethereum (ETH) as collateral. With the launch of multi-collateral Dai (DAI), Dai can now be minted using a growing variety of digital assets. Members of the DAO are also building the infrastructure to accept real-world assets (RWA) like vehicles and real estate as collateral.

#### Examples of Collateral-Backed Stablecoins

- Dai (Decentralized)
- Synthetix USD and EUR  (Decentralized)
- USDC (Centralized)

### Algorithmic

While collateral-backed stablecoins like Dai have become a foundational element in the DeFi ecosystem, a number of projects have been launched to explore protocols for generating stablecoins without collateral.

Rather than maintaining stability by accepting collateral denominated in that peg, **algorithmic** stablecoins aim to maintain their stability by employing schemes that affect the supply of tokens in response to changes in demand. 

For example, the supply of Ampleforth is programatically adjusted based on supply and demand every 24 hours to help maintain its $1 USD peg.

#### Examples of Algorithmic Stablecoins

- Ampleforth
- BASED Protocol
- Empty Set Dollar

## Comparing Stablecoins

So, what’s the best stablecoin to use? It depends on what your situation is.

Stablecoin users generally want the most stable cryptocurrency they can find; however, the availability of different stablecoins on different exchanges tends to be the limiting factor.

If someone’s trading on centralized exchanges or using them to convert profits to fiat currency, they’re probably incentivized to use certain centralized stablecoins offered by the exchange. 

Likewise, even on DEX exchanges, the most liquid stablecoin pairs will probably be the ones people use by default.

However, those looking for the censorship resistance offered by decentralized options tend to go with the most tried-and-true decentralized stablecoins. Since stablecoins are still an emerging technology, longevity in a project tends to be a meaningful indicator of reliability.

Here’s a categorized list of stablecoins:
