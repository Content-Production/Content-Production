Frankly, the trustee, the LendCo, the trust sponsor are the parties that need to be involved in every line. And they are. The most important idea to grasp is the narrative that we are trying to mimic, what we use with crypto vaults but in a real-world structure. In the context of being a verification agent, the trustee will be responsible for funds that come in and come out before they can issue a loan. Once a loan is repaid, they need to verify the outstanding debt for this given vault and then compare it to the DC. If one is greater than the other, then there's a certain action they have to take, which cuts off the downstream credit and allows the downstream loans from that to unwind organically. It's no different if we took the DC on ETH-A, when it's outstanding at whatever it is, 2 billion, and change it to 1 billion. None of those loans would be foreclosed upon or be liquidated.

In the process of scrutinizing them, we had found issues with the ESM. It didn't revoke the access of Governance to certain aspects of the system. A quick overview: the ESM is used to dump a certain amount of MKR and shut down the system. The primary intent of it is to allow an honest minority to defend against malicious majority within Governance. Another usage will be if there's were a critical bug in the system that can't be safely patched. Some minority of MKR holders could be notified and safely shut things down. It didn't work very well for the first intent of defending against a malicious majority because there was still access for governance to retain the system. The fix was to completely shut Governance out if the ESM were to get triggered. If there is a bug in the emergency shutdown process itself that Governance could intervene and repair turns out to be the exact kind of bug that we had at the end; if there was a certain amount of collateral reserved to cover Dai, and it exceeded a particular value you'd get an overflow. The end process would get stuck. Governance could have stepped into for repair, but we changed the ESM to shut Governance out completely. The fix was relatively quick.

These are three bottlenecks for scalability. We are trying to develop a vision of what things may evolve into. We have a decentralized workforce and capital allocation. One of the issues we are addressing is that MKR holders have limited bandwidth. As the ecosystem scales, you can expect MKR holders to continue getting involved in the nitty-gritty and micromanage every little thing. On the other end, there will be much involved in understanding which work needs to be funded in the DAO based on importance. We will also check the quality of every Team's work. Finally, we are concerned with the potentially coming need to have a budget limit. Currently, our budget is like a buffet as we are adding on tasty core units, and it may look like there is no limit, but sooner or later, it will happen. Then we will need to know how to prioritize core units and the DAO budget. The idea is to have a limit set for groups who develop their vision and priorities for the DAO. We can have people who work to focus on budget allocation for these goals within the budget limit. This is a very compatible and scalable idea. However, delegation is the first step. I am excited to create more documentation discussing how these ideas can evolve in the future.
